## Description of Application
This application is a quiz that asks the user questions about Javascript. An active, 75-second timer tracks how long the user takes to answer 5 questions, and each incorrect answer will remove 10 seconds from their time. The user is informed if their previous answer was correct or incorrect as the question advances. At the end of the quiz, the user's total time is displayed as their score, and they are given the option to enter their initials and submit their score. Upon submission, their score is stored in local storage, and displayed on a high score leaderboard. From here, they have the option to take the quiz again for a better time, or clear the existing high scores from the leaderboard and from local storage. This application uses Javascript itself to dynamically display and hide pages and elements, as well as store and recall scores and user initials from local storage. It also usesÂ Javascript to track and store the user's time. It uses Bootstrap CSS to style it elements, though a local CSS file is used to hide pages and elements.
